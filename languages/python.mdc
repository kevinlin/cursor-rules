# Python Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide and naming conventions
- Use type annotations to enhance code readability and type safety
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies:
  - Prefer `venv` or `poetry` for environment isolation
  - Use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to record dependencies
- Use context managers for resource handling (e.g., file operations)
- Prefer list comprehensions, generator expressions, and dictionary comprehensions
- Use `pytest` for testing and maintain high test coverage
- Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules
- Follow object-oriented design principles (SOLID)
- Use exception handling to ensure program robustness
- Use `dataclasses` or `pydantic` models to represent data
