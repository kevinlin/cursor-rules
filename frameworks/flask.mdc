# Flask rules

- Use Blueprints to organize routes by function or resource
- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy to handle database models and ORM
- Use application factories to implement flexible application initialization
- Use Flask extensions to implement common features (Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, etc.)
- Store configuration in environment variables
- Use Flask-Migrate for database migrations
- Use error handlers to implement appropriate error handling
- Use Flask-RESTful or similar tools to build APIs
