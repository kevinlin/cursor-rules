# FastAPI Rules

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (such as @app.get, @app.post, etc.) in path operation decorators
- Use dependency injection to implement shared logic, such as database connections and authentication
- Use background tasks (background tasks) for non-blocking operations
- Use appropriate status codes for responses (201 for creation, 404 for not found, etc.)
- Use APIRouter to organize routes by function or resource
- Use path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies appropriately
