# SwiftUI Rules

- Use structs to create views and keep them small and focused
- Use @State to manage simple view local state
- Use @ObservableObject with @Published to manage shared state
- Use @Binding to pass mutable state to child views
- Create custom ViewModifiers to implement reusable styles
- Use environment objects for dependency injection
- Use LazyVStack and LazyHStack for large collections
- Extract complex view logic into separate components
