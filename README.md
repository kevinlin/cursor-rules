# Cursor Rules Templates

This project is used to organize and collect Cursor rule files from different projects, providing rule support for multiple programming languages and frameworks.

## Project Overview

Cursor is an AI-assisted programming tool that uses rule files to guide its behavior. The goal of this project is to collect, organize, and standardize these rule files so that developers can make more effective use of Cursor in their development work.
